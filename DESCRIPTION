Description: This simple package computes some basic statistical operations (like mean, variance, and so on)
     that are intresting for a preliminary analysis of a phenomenon. In particular, it is useful for an analysis of
     the development of nation's population throught years. In this package there is a simple dataset which
     contains the total population of Italy, Germany and France during the period from 1970 to 2018.
     This dataset is used to load the shiny app (to run it, look at the help page of this package).
